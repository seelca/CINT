Understanding the impact of urban communities on net zero targets and sustainable future agendas can be a daunting task. The behaviour of residents is deeply related to the physical characteristics of our cities. But what if we could calculate and visualise in real-time how sustainable our cities and neighbourhoods are today, how they have been in the past and –more importantly—how they could be in the future?

CINT [City Net-zero Tool] is an analytical and predictive tool designed to quantitatively assess carbon data in urban areas. Our tool can process existing urban situations, assessing the performance of buildings, streets and transport, previous urban configurations (establishing whether a particular area has improved/worsened in the past years), as well as future developments (to evaluate the impact of proposed housing, buildings, schools, pedestrianisation of streets etc.).

CINT works on two levels: 1) assessment mode, where the model returns an accurate analysis of the carbon usage and production of a given urban area; and 2) optimisation mode, where neural networks are used to find the best carbon trade-offs to improve the existing situation, helping councils to achieve net zero targets.
